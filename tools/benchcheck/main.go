// Command benchcheck compares a benchmark run against a stored baseline and
// fails when something got slower.
//
// Every performance number in this repository was measured once by hand. That
// is how they were arrived at honestly and it is also how they rot: a kernel
// rewrite that costs 30% looks exactly like one that costs nothing until
// somebody re-runs the benchmark and remembers what it used to say. This makes
// the remembering the machine's job.

//
// The comparison is deliberately crude — the median of each benchmark's
// samples, against a percentage threshold — rather than benchstat's
// distributional test. benchstat answers "is this difference real", which
// needs enough samples to be confident and reports "~" when it is not. A gate
// has to answer "should this merge", and for that a slow-but-certain 40%
// regression and a noisy-but-likely 40% regression deserve the same answer.
//
// Noise is handled by taking the minimum of each benchmark's samples rather
// than the median — see parse for why that is the right estimator and not
// merely the optimistic one — and then by a percentage threshold on top: 25%
// by default.
//
// The threshold alone was tried first and is not enough. It assumed a
// run-to-run spread of 1-3%, and at 6 to 15 ns/op the spread against a median
// exceeds 100%.

// parse reads `go test -bench` output and returns the minimum ns/op per

//
// This was the median, on the reasoning that a gate wants the typical case
// rather than the luckiest one. That is wrong here, and the argument against
// it is not statistical taste but the shape of the noise: **benchmark
// interference is one-sided**. A frequency drop, a migration, an interrupt or
// a noisy neighbour can only ever make a run slower. Nothing makes a kernel
// finish in less time than it takes. So the distribution is the true cost plus
// a non-negative contaminant, and the minimum is the maximum-likelihood
// estimate of the true cost while the median is the true cost plus however
// much contamination reached the middle sample.
//
// That is not theoretical. Two consecutive runs of make bench-check on an idle
// machine, same commit and same binary, reported sixteen regressions and then
// five, with zero overlap — every one of them a transient that reached the
// median of a six-sample run. At 6 to 15 ns/op, which is where the small
// elementwise kernels live, a single scheduling event is larger than the
// measurement.
//
// The minimum removes exactly that contaminant and nothing else. It cannot
// hide a real regression, because a real regression raises every sample
// including the best one.
